## ✅ Best Practices

* Include audience/context (e.g. “internal dev team”, “executive update”, “public changelog”)
* Add inputs like goals, personas, or raw transcripts when available
* Use structured formats when asking for synthesis or summaries
* Ask for drafts that can be directly reused in tools like Notion, Linear, or Jira
