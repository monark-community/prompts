## ‚úÖ Best Practices

* Be explicit about your tech stack (e.g. Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
* Provide representative code snippets or edge cases for better results
* Include constraints (e.g. avoid dependencies, preserve function signatures)
* Ask for code to be production-ready unless you want a draft

## üìé Example Prompt Files

Keep filenames short and action-oriented. Use kebab-case.
Make sure to go from general to specific in your directory/file naming.
Examples;

* `refactor-component.md`: Improve the readability of a complex React component
* `test-generate.md`: Generate test cases for a utility or component
* `integrate-puppeteer`: Integrate puppeteer to utility or component
