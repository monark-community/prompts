# ðŸ§  AI Prompts Repository

This repository contains curated, reusable prompts to guide AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT, Lovable, etc.) in accomplishing tasks across development, design, product, and operations.

Our goal is to:

* Standardize how we interact with AI tools
* Improve output quality through clear instructions
* Empower teams to automate and accelerate common tasks

## âœ… Prompt Format Guidelines

All prompts should follow this structure:

* **Context**: Brief description of the task and intended agent.
* **Instructions**: Clear and direct request for the agent.
* **Constraints**: Any technical or formatting limitations.
* **Expected Output**: Ideal structure or result.

Use Markdown for formatting. Avoid long context dumps. Keep it focused and reusable.

* `roles/dev/frontend-scaffold.md`: Start a Next.js 15 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui SaaS app
* `roles/design/ux-audit.md`: Ask an agent to review a layout for usability
* `roles/product/prd-generator.md`: Generate a PRD from a user need statement

---

## ðŸš« What Not To Do

* Donâ€™t hardcode secrets or credentials in example prompts
* Donâ€™t create tool-specific prompts without naming the tool
* Donâ€™t duplicate prompts across folders
